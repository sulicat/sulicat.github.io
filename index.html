    <div class="title">The Resistance of the Working Class to the Industrial Revolution</div>

    <p>
      The industrial revolution is a time in history between 1760 and 1820 when a large section of the world (Europe and US) saw a massive rise in the use of machinary for manufacturing. The US saw a large increase in population during that time too. One of the characteristics of the Industrial Revolution is that lots of people worked in factories. It is known that a lot of the working conditions in factories were abhorant, from low wages and descrimination to extremely unsafe conditions in the workplace. There was a lot of resistance demonstrated by the working class (In the form of protests). Was that resistance justifiable? Was life infact better for the working class than we may believe? There are some aspects of life that did improve, notably the price of goods decreasing and the wider availability of goods due to mass production.

      The question I would like answered is, "if the industrial revolution had not happened during the lives of the working class from 1760 to 1820, would their lives have been better ? (statistically, not on a single person basis)".
      <br><br>
      In order to attempt to answer this question, I had to research the pros and cons of the Industrial Revolution to the working class, and then think to myself, how could peoples' lives have looked if the industrial revolution happened later, or if it happened in a more gradual fashion.

      Of the reading we did in class, the story "Sweat" by Zora Neale Hurston and the book "The Jungle" by Upton Sinclair are the most relevent to this topic.
      <br><br>
      The book The Jungle describes the conditions people went through in the Meat District in Chicago. Many of the conditions portrayed are horrible and in some regards unbelievably bad, some examples are "upon tens of thousands of cattle crowded into pens whose wooden floors stank and steamed contagion; upon bare, blistering, cinder-strewn railroad tracks, and huge blocks of dingy meat factories, whose labyrinthine passages defied a breath of fresh air to penetrate them; and there were not merely rivers of hot blood, and car-loads of moist flesh, and rendering vats and soap caldrons, glue factories and fertilizer tanks, that smelt like the craters of hell—there were also tons of garbage festering in the sun, and the greasy laundry of the workers hung out to dry, and dining rooms littered with food and black with flies, and toilet rooms that were open sewers." (Sinclair Ch. 26). In this case, the scene described is during a strike, and it is indeed horrible to imagine and fathom.
      <br><br>
      The book also describes the monetary strugles by showing a big strong man, Jurgis, break down due to his fiscal state after buying a home. "Yes, they had bought the house, they had really bought it. It belonged to them, they had only to pay the money and it would be all right. Then Jurgis covered his face with his hands, for there were tears in his eyes, and he felt like a fool. But he had had such a horrible fright; strong man as he was, it left him almost too weak to stand up."(Sinclair Ch. 4).
      <br><br>
      There are also cases in which the book describes the huge wealth disparity between the rich and working class during that period, stating that the rich not only have money, but also means to make even more money, prepatually increasing the disparity. "The rich people not only had all the money, they had all the chance to get more; they had all the know-ledge and the power, and so the poor man was down, and he had to stay down."(Sinclair Ch. 4).
      <br><br>
      I firmly believe that yes, the conditions described in the book are real and there are papers that validate this belief such as a letter from the President of the United States at the time Theodore Roosevelt urging legistlation to be passed to put a stop to the abuses. It is also important to keep in mind that Sinclair was not the only person who wrote about these conditions.

      The story "Sweat" describes the life of Delia Jones, written in the 1920s it is a fictional story where Delia is hard working woman living a little after the second industrial revolution. What we can learn by reading the text is that life for Delia is not as hard as life was for Jurgis in "The Jungle", and definately not as ristricting as life for a family living in a large urbanized city. The reason I believe this is that Delia has the ability to support a house of 2 people all on her own. This can be seen during the story when Delia says she paid for the house herself. "What
      's it got to do with you, Sykes?
      Mah tub of suds is filled yo' belly with vittles more times than yo' hands is filled it. Mah sweat is 
done paid for this house and Ah reckon Ah kin keep on sweatin' in it."(Hurston Pg.1)
      <br><br>
      We can also see that the working conditions for Delia are not as bad as the working conditions for people in large cities during the Industrial revolution, Delia is a washwoman, she does not have to work in a factory around dangorous equipment and unhygeinic conditions. "But she was a washwoman, and Monday morning meant a great deal to her." (Hurston Pg. 1) That as well as better living conditions for Delia, even though she lived with an abusive husband, she had the authority to
