    <div class="title">The Resistance of the Working Class to the Industrial Revolution</div>

    <p>
      &emsp;The industrial revolution is a time in history between 1760 and 1820 when a large section of the world (Europe and US) saw a massive rise in the use of machinery for manufacturing. The US saw a large increase in population during that time too. One of the characteristics of the Industrial Revolution is that lots of people worked in factories. It is known that a lot of the working conditions in factories were abhorrent, from low wages and discrimination to extremely unsafe conditions in the workplace. There was a lot of resistance demonstrated by the working class (In the form of protests). Was that resistance justifiable? Was life in fact better for the working class than we may believe? There are some aspects of life that did improve, notably the price of goods decreasing and the wider availability of goods due to mass production.

      &emsp;The question I would like answered is, "During the Industrial Revolution, how bad was the life of an average working class citizen?".
      <br><br>
      &emsp;Of the readings we did in class, the story "Sweat" by Zora Neale Hurston and the book "The Jungle" by Upton Sinclair are the most relevent to this topic.
      <br><br>
      &emsp;The book "The Jungle" describes the conditions people went through in the Meat District in Chicago. Many of the conditions portrayed are horrible and in some regards unbelievably bad, some examples are "upon tens of thousands of cattle crowded into pens whose wooden floors stank and steamed contagion; upon bare, blistering, cinder-strewn railroad tracks, and huge blocks of dingy meat factories, whose labyrinthine passages defied a breath of fresh air to penetrate them; and there were not merely rivers of hot blood, and car-loads of moist flesh, and rendering vats and soap caldrons, glue factories and fertilizer tanks, that smelt like the craters of hellâ€”there were also tons of garbage festering in the sun, and the greasy laundry of the workers hung out to dry, and dining rooms littered with food and black with flies, and toilet rooms that were open sewers." (Sinclair Ch. 26). In this case, the scene described is during a strike, and it is indeed horrible to imagine and fathom.
      <br><br>
      &emsp;The book also describes the monetary struggles by showing a big strong man, Jurgis, break down due to his fiscal state after buying a home. "Yes, they had bought the house, they had really bought it. It belonged to them, they had only to pay the money and it would be all right. Then Jurgis covered his face with his hands, for there were tears in his eyes, and he felt like a fool. But he had had such a horrible fright; strong man as he was, it left him almost too weak to stand up."(Sinclair Ch. 4).
      <br><br>
      &emsp;There are also cases in which the book describes the huge wealth disparity between the rich and working class during that period, stating that the rich not only have money, but also means to make even more money, perpetually increasing the disparity. "The rich people not only had all the money, they had all the chance to get more; they had all the know-ledge and the power, and so the poor man was down, and he had to stay down."(Sinclair Ch. 4).
      <br><br>
      &emsp;I firmly believe that yes, the conditions described in the book are real and there are papers that validate this belief such as a letter from the President of the United States at the time Theodore Roosevelt urging legistlation to be passed to put a stop to the abuses. It is also important to keep in mind that Sinclair was not the only person who wrote about these conditions.
      <br><br>
      &emsp;The story "Sweat" describes the life of Delia Jones, written in the 1920s it is a fictional story where Delia is hard working woman living a little after the second industrial revolution. What we can learn by reading the text is that life for Delia is not as hard as life was for Jurgis in "The Jungle", and definitely not as restricting as life for a family living in a large urbanized city. The reason I believe this is that Delia has the ability to support a house of 2 people all on her own. This can be seen during the story when Delia says she paid for the house herself. "What
      's it got to do with you, Sykes?
      Mah tub of suds is filled yo' belly with vittles more times than yo' hands is filled it. Mah sweat is 
done paid for this house and Ah reckon Ah kin keep on sweatin' in it."(Hurston Pg.1)
      <br><br>
      &emsp;We can also see that the working conditions for Delia are not as bad as the working conditions for people in large cities during the Industrial revolution, Delia is a washwoman, she does not have to work in a factory around dangerous equipment and unhygienic conditions. "But she was a washwoman, and Monday morning meant a great deal to her." (Hurston Pg. 1) That as well as better living conditions for Delia, even though she lived with an abusive husband, she had the authority to threaten to kick him out of the house, and her husband Sykes had the leisure of wasting a significant chunk of his day with his mistress. "Ah don't keer if you never git through. Anyhow, Ah done promised Gawd and a couple of 
other men, Ah aint gointer have it in mah house. Don't gimme no lip neither, else Ah'll throw 'em out 
and put mah fist up side yo' head to boot." (Hurston Pg. 1)

      &emsp;There are many people who talk about the pros and cons of the Industrial Revolution, John P. Rafferty, an Editor at Encyclopedia Britannica mentions many of these. He mentions the cost of goods decreasing "Factories and the machines that they housed began to produce items faster and cheaper than could be made by hand. As the supply of various items rose, their cost to the consumer declined" (Rafferty) and also talks about an enhanced quality of life for the average person, "Mass production lowered the costs of much-needed tools, clothes, and other household items for the common (that is, non aristocratic) people, which allowed them to save money for other things and build personal wealth." (Rafferty). This writer also talks about the cons that include Overcrowding of cities,  Environmental Ills and very poor working conditions. We can learn from this text that the Industrial Revolution did not only benefit the rich of the time, but also many of the common people.

      &emsp;With regards to literary works that speak about the conditions of the working class in during the Industrial Revolution. There was a magazine name  "McClure's Magazine" that was dedicated towards "muckraking journalism". Some of the works included in the magazine where instrumental in describing the conditions at the time and aiding in the establishment of more functional laws to protect workers.
    <br><br>
    &emsp;In the magazine, there was an piece written by Ida Tarbell that talked about the unjustness and the control people with wealth had, this further strengthens the argument of the wealth disparity and lack of opportunity for the working class. She said "didn't care about anyone he did anything just to be rich and be the only company standing without any competition. He destroyed anyone else." (Tarbell) talking about John D. Rockefeller.
    <br><br>
    &emsp;In this magazine, there was also articles that depicted the lawlessness of the time. One such article is "What is a Lynching?" by Ray Stannard Baker. This text speaks about how a lynching happened. "A sort of dry rot, a moral paralysis, seems to strike the administrators of law in a town like Springfield. What can be expected of officers who are not accustomed to enforce the law, or of a people not accustomed to obey it - or who make reservations and exceptions when they do enforce it or obey it?" (Baker). Here Baker is describing how the enforcement officers are unable to make a decision as to whether or not to stop the lynching from occurring, the target was an African American man inside a jail cell. This very clearly shows the level of lawlessness experienced in big cities at the time.

      &emsp;In the video shown above, the speaker talks about the industrial revolution. He mentions many of the same things we have encountered online, but also talks a lot about the benefits of the industrial revolution, mentioning many inventions integral to life today. Most notably, the video talks about the rapid rise in populations of cities stating an increase in the amount of people living in cities from 15% to 85% in around 150 years. While his example is of Great Britain, the USA exhibits the same changes, as he mentions at the end of his video. (Simple History).
      <br><br>
      &emsp;It is very clear that the industrial revolution is the reason we are able to enjoy the technology we have today, we have easy access to clothes, water, food and we have laws that govern the workplace. We have laws such as anti-trust laws, equal opportunity employment and minimum wage because of the horrible working conditions experienced by factory workers during the Industrial Revolution.

    <div class="subtitle">Interconnection</div>
    <p>
      &emsp;Were the living conditions for the working class as bad as many people believe? It's hard to say. For starters there is a lot of text about the working conditions and workplace laws, there is even a word, "muckracking", used to describe the act of outing corruption in business. However I could not find any solid statistics about the amount of people facing conditions that Jurgis experienced in "The Jungle". Although writers such as Ida Tarbell and Upton Sinclair do write accurately about working conditions, they do not provide a picture of the average or the "norm". Many people willingly moved to cities in hopes of lives better than they had previously, and many of the problems described in the literature are problems we face today. Some of these problems such as the growing wealth gap between the middle class and the wealthy, as well as the minimum wage not being able to afford a family and a good life are ones we argue about in politics all the time. However there is one thing that has improved, and that is that there is less opportunity for businesses to take advantage of workers.

    <div class="subtitle">What Now?</div>
    <p>
     &emsp;After reading the texts and doing some research, I believe that the working conditions were as bad as described and maybe even worse. However I also cannot make any conclusions as to how common these bad working conditions are since the Industrial Revolution also occurred in areas outside of Chicago and Ohio, and I was unable to find statistics on the average person and what the "norm" working class conditions are. An interesting question to ponder is whether these horrible working conditions not being stopped early on actually helped us as by enabling companies to accumulate wealth and develop their technologies?
